### Pre-built websites with GatsbyJS
How many sizes and types of phones exists these days? How many kinds of devices might access your site? Using industry-proven tools like Gatsby, we create optimal versions of your site before launching to global endpoints: this guarantees it looks great on any screen and loads super fast.

### Client control over content
Whether they prefer a custom app or a WordPress site, our clients retain full control over their core site content at all times. Edits to vitals like business logos, pictures, contact info and addresses can be made by the owner, without any revisions to the code.

### Accessibility and usability impact everyone
Some people will view your site in ways you won't and some will listen to it with a screen reader. Jacks Media adds internal tags to your site content, ensuring nothing is lost with different types of access modes, and helps future-proof your site against tomorrow's tech.
